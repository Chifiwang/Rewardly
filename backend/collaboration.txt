I only collaborated with my project teammates.

Chifeng had already implemented the user authentication and schema when I joined his group.
I worked on the Event endpoints, some parts of the user endpoints (the multer img file upload endpoint), and some bug fixes in the transaction endpoints.

Mark worked on the Transaction endpoints mainly, and Chifeng also handled the promotion endpoints.
